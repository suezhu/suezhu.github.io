                        <br/><br/>However, I didn’t fully enjoy the sunset because I don’t want to miss Neowise.  I picked the spot and set up the tripod for taking the picture.  Then one person came by and stood pretty close to me which made me uncomfortable – social distance remember!  Later one, we found out that he also tried to take photo and he wanted my spot.  He mentioned that I took the best spot then he moved to another place nearby.
                        <br/><br/>Neowise started its show and I finally got enjoy it.  It was bright and it sat below big dipper.  It took me three tries to see it.  I will have to wait another 5000 years to see it again.  I hope by that time, I am not too old.
                        <br/><br/>I started taking pictures at 9:00PM but I could not get a good shot.  I was there till 2:30AM.  This is the best shot I got for these five and half hours.  See the top one with a tail.  That is Neowise.

                        <br/><br/>When I showed this photo to my daughter, her comment was “Camera is dusty.  You should wipe it.”  This is our third attempt.
