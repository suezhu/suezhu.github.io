                        <br/><br/>Our first failure was upsetting but we did learn from our mistakes.  Based on my understanding, Neowise started to move away from sun starting early July.  Hence the earlier it is, the brighter Neowise would be.   I would like to give it another try on Wednesday July 15, 2020.  Weather forecast predicted clear sky on that day.  
                        <br/><br/>It was a week day and we needed to work so we drove around the day before to pick a good spot closer to home (~30 minute drive).  On July 15, 2020, we woke up around 3:00AM and got to that spot on 3:45AM.  We waited there and we didnâ€™t see Neowise!  I believed the place we picked still has too much city light.  And that was the day we can watch Neowise both early evening and early morning.  Perhaps it was too close to the horizon that we could not see it?!
                        <br/><br/>We came back home around 5:00AM disappointedly.  I went to bed and set the alarm at 10:00AM before my first meeting.  I wake up with a good rest of that day!
                        <br/><br/>The second attempt ended with a good sleep.
