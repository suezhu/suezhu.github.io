                        I read about comet Neowise from the news that it is one of the brightest comets in the northern hemisphere and I can see it with the naked eye in July 2020.  There were so many beautiful photos which made me even more eager to see it and to take photo. 
                        <br/><br/>I read that the best time to watch Neowise is between 4:00 and 4:15AM.  This time is a torture for me since I am not an early morning person and I hate getting up early.  However in order to see Neowise, I decided to made a sacrifice.  
                        <br/><br/>On Saturday July 11, 2020, I told my husband my plan of leaving home around 1:00AM and drove to the east Washington to look for Neowise which should appear at the northern east sky.  My husband went to bed very early to prepare for this trip while I decided to staying awake till 1:00AM. 
                        <br/><br/>We left home around 1:30AM which was not too bad for my plan.  Then we got into trouble trying to put gasoline in a gas station.  That pump took our credit card but we could not put gas into our car.  The worst part was we could not get our card out.  After struggling for a while, we decided to cancel our card which took us three tries to finally report lost card to our credit card company.  By the time we left that gas station, it was 3:00AM - two hours late!
                        <br/><br/>When we started driving east, we noticed that it was cloudy which made me worried.  From the weather forecast, I knew that east side of Washington should have clear sky.  We did manage to get to a place where there was less cloud but it was 4:50AM already.  The sky was too bright to see any star and of course we missed the Neowise!
