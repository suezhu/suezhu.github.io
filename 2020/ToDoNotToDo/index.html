                        <br/><br/>I have been thinking about how to start.  Giving current special situation â€“ COVID19, I want to start with face masks.  
                        <br/><br/>As you can imagine, I talked a lot and never tried to play silence.  Hence I joined many social media groups and enjoy them very much.  On January 26, 2020, one of my social media groups had a request on face masks.  This group has all my fellow students from the same college in the same year of graduation.  Three of them needed face masks and they could not get them in China.  One of them took subway everyday to work and it was very risky for him to be in the jammed subway carriage without a face mask.  It would be a lifesaving for him.
                        <br/><br/>Learning this, my heart went with them and I wanted to help.  Think about it, the face masks might mean a life or death for them.  Generally, I made donations all the time and this should be one of my donations.  However this one is specially different because I can see the immediate outcomes.  I valued this opportunity.  
                        <br/><br/>I searched everywhere to try to get face masks.  At that time, the face masks were difficult to find because many people donated to China to help fighting against the virus early January.  Then the first COVID-19 case identified in US.  This triggered people to start hoarding different materials.  Face masks were one of them.
