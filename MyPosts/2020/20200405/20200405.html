                        <br/><br/>We have been staying at home for a month now.  It was 3/5/2020 we started working from home!  It is exactly one month today!!
                        <br/><br/>Thanks God for keeping us safe and healthy!  Thanks for all the people fighting the virus!!!
                        <br/><br/>Generally, we drove around and we would not get out of car if there were a lot of people.  We only went out when there were no people or less people.  Nowadays, I prefer nature scenery and animals.  
                        <br/><br/>Today, we saw about 80 people and most didnâ€™t wear masks.  We saw four masked people.  Most interesting was one guy driving alone with mask.  I could not understand why he was with mask while he was alone in his car.
