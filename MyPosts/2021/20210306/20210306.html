                        <br/><br/>Yesterday March 5 was the one year anniversary of my first “working from home” day. 
                        <br/><br/>We are so lucky and fortunate.  Thanks for God blessing!!
                        <br/><br/>This year so many things were different.
                        <br/><br/>First was that I didn’t go to any shop and restaurant.  End result was that we ate home cooked meal everyday and we didn’t buy any unnecessary items.
                        <br/><br/>Second was I didn’t go to office to work.  I worked from home.  So the sloppy clothes became new normal and I can’t remember what a business casual was anymore.  
                        <br/><br/>Third was that every weekend we spent one day driving around just to get out of our house.  Hence we went to many places where we never knew and saw many wonderful sceneries.
                        <br/><br/>Fourth was that we had no gathering with any friend.  As a result, I downloaded and signed up many social media apps.  I was really busy at the evening after work.  
                        <br/><br/>Life could be like this!
                        <br/><br/>
